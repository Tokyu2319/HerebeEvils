# Regions  
The universe is infinite and organized into **regions** — large-scale equivalence clusters of realities. Within a region, insignificant micro-variations exist but are considered manifestations of a single macro-trajectory. When divergence becomes narratively or structurally meaningful, a new region forms rather than a new variation within the same region.  
  
Divergence between regions is gradual rather than random. regions closest to one’s home region share nearly identical histories, people, and structures. As one travels farther through the infinite universe, these differences accumulate, and regions become increasingly unfamiliar in culture, events, and societal development — while still obeying the same fundamental laws of reality.  
- ## The *Conceptual* Shape of Each Region and The Shape of The Universe  
	A region in the universe takes on the geometric shape called a truncated octahedron, see image below:  
	<img src="../assets/image.gif" alt=”” width="200">  
	It is an octahedron with its corners cut off  
	It has 8 hexagons and 6 Squares as its faces  
	It has 36 edges and 24 vertices and it’s Archimedean, meaning highly symmetric  
	These characteristics allow the truncated octahedron to be tiled with each other leaving no empty spaces. The gif below is what a cluster of these regions would look like:

	Crossing through either the square face or the hexagonal face will feel different from each other.   
# The Fabric of Spacetime  
The fabric of spacetime is a geometric 4-dimensional grid—wherein time is the fourth dimension—that curves and deforms around massive objects. Such deformation allows the use of [portal magic](../3.%20Magic/3.6%20Portal%20Magic.md).  
  
Deformities of spacetime are **smoothened out** once the force causing them is removed.
