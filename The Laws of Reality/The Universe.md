# Infinity and Its Possibilities  
The universe stretches infinitely, yet the possibilities for arranging matter are limited. If you travel far enough, those arrangements must eventually repeat. You would encounter another version of yourself, an alternate history of your world, or something entirely unrecognizable—each a different variations of the same finite possibilities.  
  
These are regions of the universe, and they grow more distinct as you move from one to the next. In a neighboring region you might find yourself as the president of a country; farther on, you are a soldier in a war. Skip enough regions and you are no longer “you” at all, but a different identity shaped by different circumstances. To that person, you are the strange variation—because **there is no original region**.  
  
One might expect infinity to produce near-identical worlds, separated only by a single grain of sand. That is not the nature of this universe. Trivial differences collapse together, forming coherent regions rather than endless noise.  
# Coarse-Grained Universe  
The universe distinguishes what is significant and disregards what is not. Meaningful differences remain separate; insignificant variations are merged within the same region. Regions do not blend at random but only with those that share the same essential character.  
  
- ## The Shape of Each Region and The Shape of The Universe  
	A region in the universe takes on the geometric shape called a truncated octahedron, see image below:  
	<img src="../assets/image.gif" alt=”” width="200">  
	It is an octahedron with its corners cut off  
	It has 8 hexagons and 6 Squares as its faces  
	It has 36 edges and 24 vertices and it’s Archimedean, meaning highly symmetric  
	These characteristics allow the truncated octahedron to be tiled with each other leaving no empty spaces. The gif below is what a cluster of these regions would look like:

	All of this is to show that there’s a threshold between regions separating them, signifying that you have left your region and are about to enter another.  
# The Fabric of Spacetime  
The fabric of spacetime is a geometric 4-dimensional grid (wherein time is the fourth dimension) that curves and deforms around massive objects. Such deformation allows the use of [portal](../Magic/Portal%20Magic.md) magic.
