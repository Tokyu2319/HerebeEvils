# Growing Block   
Time is a block that grows upwards (or any direction that you’d prefer), the past is the block, the present is the growth shown, and the future is the empty space above the block which has yet to be occupied. This means the past and present exist now; the future has yet to exist. Time is globally accretive, however, time can be locally malleaable.  
## The Tampering of Time and Temporal Consistency Enforcement  
An outside force may act upon the gears of time; to manipulate for their own purposes or accidentally throw a stick in it.  
Temporal consistency enforcement makes it so that paradoxes are impossible to create, the universe will forcefully manipulate anything or anyone so that a paradox will not happen.  
  
Simply put, if a person travels back in time to where Hitler will fail his art test with the intent to change him, that person will come across many ordeals thrown in by the universe to stop him from meeting Hitler. When the person eventually does meet Hitler despite the ordeals, the person will forget what they were doing and go back to the present. The paradox here is that the person wouldn’t know Hitler if WW2 never started, therefore, the intent to change Hitler would never exist.  
  
However, some changes in the past are allowed simply because it doesn’t create any paradoxes. If a person travels back in time with no real reason they may end up changing some parts in the present. This does not mean that the person is free from the universes enforcement, the person will subconsciously follow what the universe forces them to do in order to not create paradoxes.
