> Memory, within a [vessel](./Beings.md), is the capacity to store and recall information. This capacity is likewise present within a [being’s](./Beings.md) [mind](./Beings.md). The loss of the vessel entails the loss of the mind, and the loss of either the mind or the vessel entails the loss of a being’s memory.  
  
There is a stark difference between memory inside a vessel and memory inside a being’s mind. Memory inside a vessel is just information, whether that be connections between synapses or data in a hardware. Memory inside a being’s mind is (what I define) a being’s identity, the mind’s purpose is to interpret [experience](./Experience.md) to the [soul](./Beings.md) but <u>as a byproduct it forms information</u> in the mind which can be lost when the mind is destroyed. There is a way to restore a being’s identity and that would be [resurrection magic](../Magic/Resurrection%20Magic.md).
