There’s two distinct types of memories, the [vessel](./Beings.md)’s memory and the [mind](./Beings.md)’s memory.  
  
The vessel’s memory is the capacity to store and recall information. connecting synapses and data in a hardware are information inside a vessel’s cognition.  
  
The mind’s memory is what I define as a [being](./Beings.md)’s identity. **During the process of interpreting [experiences](./Experience.md) the mind will form memories as a byproduct**. These memories are separate from the vessel’s memories as they can be manipulated by [manon](../Magic/Mana.md).  
  
The vessel’s memories are lost when it’s destroyed and the same happens to the mind’s memories. **Recovering a soul’s mind and its memories is possible due to the existence of [resurrection magic](../Magic/Resurrection%20Magic.md).**
