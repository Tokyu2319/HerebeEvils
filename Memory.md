> Memory, within a [[./Beings|vessel]], is the capacity to store and recall information. This capacity is likewise present within a [[./Beings|being’s]] [[./Beings|mind]]. The loss of the vessel entails the loss of the mind, and the loss of either the mind or the vessel entails the loss of a being’s memory.

There is a stark difference between memory inside a vessel and memory inside a being’s mind. Memory inside a vessel is just information, whether that be connections between synapses or data in a hardware. Memory inside a being’s mind is (what I define) a being’s identity, the mind’s purpose is to interpret [[./Experience|experience]] to the [[./Beings|soul]] but <u>as a byproduct it forms information</u> in the mind. There is a way to restore a being’s identity and that would be [[./Transience|resurrection magic]].
