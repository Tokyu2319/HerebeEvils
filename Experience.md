> Experience is what the [soul](./Beings.md) of a being gains from living through moments, doing things, or perceiving something over time. Everything a being goes through counts as experience. This includes direct encounters, knowledge gained, subjective perception, thoughts, and much more.  
>   
> The amount of experience in a soul determines its value.  
>   
> There are limits to how much experience a being can gain. Experiencing the same thing repeatedly does not contribute to the growth of a being’s soul.  
> For example, a being such as GLaDOS spends their entire lifetime in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center. The only way GLaDOS can gain additional experience is by conducting scientific experiments — but GLaDOS will not gain any new experience from performing the same tests over and over.  
>   
> The amount of experience gained can range from low to high depending on a being’s reaction to a moment.  
>   
> Seeing the same tree every day may still provide a small amount of experience if it inspires new thoughts or perceptions, while participating in a war yields an extremely high amount of experience due to the intensity, danger, and emotional impact involved.
