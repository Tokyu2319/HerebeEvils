This topic will explain how the [mana triad](./Mana.md) and created matter interact with each other.  
# Interactions Between The Mana Triad  
- ## Raw Mana Interaction  
	- Mana particles colliding with phana particles will convert itself into more phana particles making it radiate more heat and/or make it brighter by increasing its luminosity.  
	- Mana particles colliding with uncontrolled manon particles will convert itself into more manon particles making it exhibit more force.  
	- Mana particles colliding with armana particles will **not** convert the mana into armana particles instead the armana will make it so that the mana decays slower and even more slower if designed so. Mana also makes the armana particles more tangible.  
- ## Phana Interaction  
	- Phana particles colliding with mana particles will convert the mana into more phana particles making it radiate more heat and/or make it brighter by increasing its luminosity.  
	- Phana particles interacting with controlled manon particles allows the control of the beam and wavelength of the phana particles.  
	- Phana particles colliding with armana particles will either be blocked or scattered by armana particles. Intense heat from phana particles may disrupt or destroy armana structures.  
- ## Manon Interaction  
	- Uncontrolled manon particles colliding with mana particles will convert the mana into manon particles making it exhibit more force.  
	- Controlled manon particles interacting with phana particles allows the control of the beam and wavelength of the phana particles.  
	- Controlled manon particles interacting with armana particles allow the control of the structure and [complexity](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Beings.md) of the armana particles.  
- ## Armana Interaction  
	- Armana particles colliding with mana particles will **not** convert the mana into armana particles instead the armana will make it so that the mana decays slower and even more slower if designed so. Mana also makes the armana particles more tangible.  
	- Armana particles that has been collided with phana particles will either block or scatter the phana particles. Intense heat from phana particles may disrupt or destroy armana structures.  
	- Armana particles interacting with controlled manon particles allow the control of the structure and complexity of the armana particles.  
# Matter Interaction with The Mana Triad  
- ## Raw Mana Interaction  
	There is no interaction between matter and raw mana, raw mana phases through substances.  
- ## Phana interaction  
	Liquefaction will occur when matter collides with the intense heat of phana particles.   
	Electronics may respond to controlled phana particles via the replication of electromagnetic waves.  
- ## Manon Interaction  
	Allows control over anything really. Want to heat the bathtub? Use manon to vibrate the water molecules. Want to freeze water? Use manon to gradually lock water molecules in place (I say gradually because otherwise you’re gonna end up with plasma). Want to see a solar eclipse? Stretch large amounts of manon to the moon in order to move it however you like.  
- ## Armana Interaction  
	Since armana is tangible it can collide with matter. This is useful for shields if an opposing mage decides to use a gun instead of magic. Armana can also be used as a substitute in electronics, an example being armana wires carrying electric current.

# Examples of Spells (Excluding The Use of [Enchantments](./Enchantments.md))  
- ## Flamethrower  
	The creation of flammable gasses from a medium which they control the trajectory using manon, phana is used as an ignition. The continuous creation of fuel is needed to keep the flame burning.  
- ## Lightning  
	Cast a field of manon to establish a field of influence (better if you’re in a humid or dusty place). This manon field is easily disruptible but it allows the subtle use of  manon (micro-telekinesis). In this field you can manipulate positive and negative charges of objects inside the field to create a charge imbalance while also having a chain of manon as the conductive path.  
- ## Magelight  
	A ball of phana supported by manon.  
- ## Telekinesis  
	The general use of manon.  
- ## Ascendant Telekinesis  
	Telekinesis with the awareness that manon can manipulate microscopically and macroscopically.  
- ## Rupture  
	Direct use of manon to forcefully tear a person or object. Ineffective at long range due to easy disruption.  
# Interpreting Magics From Other Medias  
- ## Arcana Slave  
	From Project Moon’s Library of Ruina, Arcana Slave could be interpreted as a beam of high energy phana focused down with manon.  
- ## Zoltraak  
	From Kanehito Yamada’s ｢山田 鐘人｣ Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, Zoltraak is a simple spell which could be interpreted as high energy phana guided and curved by manon to be used as an offensive attack.
