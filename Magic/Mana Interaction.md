This topic will explain how the [mana triad](./Mana.md) and created matter interact with each other.  
# Interactions Between The Mana Triad  
- ## Raw Mana Interaction  
	- Mana particles colliding with phana particles will convert itself into more phana particles making it radiate more heat and/or make it brighter by increasing its luminosity.  
	- Mana particles colliding with uncontrolled manon particles will convert itself into more manon particles making it exhibit more force.  
	- Mana particles colliding with armana particles will **not** convert the mana into armana particles instead the armana will make it so that the mana decays slower and even more slower if designed so. Mana also makes the armana particles more tangible.  
- ## Phana Interaction  
	- Phana particles colliding with mana particles will convert the mana into more phana particles making it radiate more heat and/or make it brighter by increasing its luminosity.  
	- Phana particles interacting with controlled manon particles allows the control of the beam and wavelength of the phana particles.  
	- Phana particles colliding with armana particles will either be blocked or scattered by armana particles. Intense heat from phana particles may disrupt or destroy armana structures.  
- ## Manon Interaction  
	- Uncontrolled manon particles colliding with mana particles will convert the mana into manon particles making it exhibit more force.  
	- Controlled manon particles interacting with phana particles allows the control of the beam and wavelength of the phana particles.  
	- Controlled manon particles interacting with armana particles allow the control of the structure and [complexity](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Beings.md) of the armana particles.  
- ## Armana Interaction  
	- Armana particles colliding with mana particles will **not** convert the mana into armana particles instead the armana will make it so that the mana decays slower and even more slower if designed so. Mana also makes the armana particles more tangible.  
	- Armana particles that has been collided with phana particles will either block or scatter the phana particles. Intense heat from phana particles may disrupt or destroy armana structures.  
	- Armana particles interacting with controlled manon particles allow the control of the structure and complexity of the armana particles.  
# Matter Interaction with The Mana Triad  
- ## Raw Mana Interaction  
	There is no interaction between matter and raw mana, raw mana phases through substances.  
- ## Phana interaction  
	Liquefaction will occur when matter collides with the intense heat of phana particles.   
	Electronics may respond to controlled phana particles via the replication of electromagnetic waves.  
- ## Manon Interaction  
	Allows control over anything really. Want to heat the bathtub? Use manon to vibrate the water molecules. Want to freeze water? Use manon to gradually lock water molecules in place (I say gradually because otherwise you’re gonna end up with plasma). Want to see a solar eclipse? Stretch large amounts of manon to the moon in order to move it however you like.  
- ## Armana Interaction  
	Since armana is tangible it can collide with matter. This is useful for shields if an opposing mage decides to use a gun instead of magic. Armana can also be used as a substitute in electronics, an example being armana wires carrying electric current.

# Examples of Spells (Excluding The Use of [Enchantments](./Enchantments.md))  
- ## Flamethrower  
	A mage creates flammable gasses from their palms in which they control their movement using manon, they then ignite the gasses using a burst of hot phana. They continually create gasses to fuel the flame until their enemy is burned.  
- ## Lightning  
	A mage stretches manon over the field of influence, however, this can easily be disrupted by opposing mages. Once the a field of manon has been established, the mage is able to move electrons within that field using manon in order to create a separation in charge. The mage then creates the lightning’s trajectory using a path of manon, the mage is now able to safely create a discharge resulting in lightning.  
- ## Magelight  
	A ball of phani supported by manon.  
- ## Arcana Slave  
	From Project Moon’s Library of Ruina, Arcana Slave could be interpreted as a mass of high energy phani focused down with manon.  
- ## Telekinesis  
	The general use of manon.  
- ## Ascendant Telekinesis  
	Telekinesis with the awareness that manon can manipulate microscopically and macroscopically.
