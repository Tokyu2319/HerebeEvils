> Resurrection can happen naturally or artificially, I’ll be explaining what that means in this topic  
  
Resurrection happens when a donor [transient](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Transience.md) soul is used on a another transient soul in which case the transient soul will have their [memories](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Memory.md) back while the donor soul will be **destroyed** once used. The value of the transient soul will determine how many donor souls it will take to resurrect them.  
  
# Artificial Resurrection  
Artificial resurrection happens when a [being](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Beings.md) forces a donor soul to be used on a another soul or themselves, this is taboo in some cultures and an irredeemable crime for the latter.  
# Natural Resurrection  
Natural resurrection happens when transient souls collide with each other, It is likely that the donor soul won’t activate the resurrection, however. It does happen nonetheless. The chances, though, do get higher when the universe approaches its [end](The%20End.md).
