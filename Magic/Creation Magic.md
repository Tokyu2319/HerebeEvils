This topic will introduce creation magic as well as different types of healing magic.  
  
# In-depth Explanation of Creation Magic  
Matter is created when a [being](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Beings.md) uses mana to convert it into matter, to make a gram of water you’d need 1.000 mana particles. Matter is created directly on the surface of a vessel (this surface can be inside or outside of a vessel) and will produce energy as a byproduct, the energy produced can be mitigated by having an understanding of chemistry and an adept control over [manon](./Mana.md). Fluids are easy to create to create as they flow out of the vessel while solids are complicated to make.  
- ## Creation Magic Techniques  
	Extrusive Creation  
	The creation of matter by **extruding** it outward from a vessel.  
	— Example: Creating a copper rod from your hands.  
	  
	Laminative Creation  
	The creation of matter by **lamination**, forming layer by layer within and surrounded by a vessel.  
	— Example: Creating food or nutrients within the stomach’s fluids.  
# Different Types of Healing Magic  
Healing magic are separated on how complicated they are and how much biology knowledge you need starting with archaic healing magic to restoration magic.  
## Archaic Healing Magic  
Archaic healing magic is the creation of nutrients. Mana share can allow the user to provide healing to another whether they’re a plant or an animal. Archaic healing magic if performed carefully, may provide enough food and water for a being to last days without actually consuming any, rather than burning rations they’re burning their own thread of life to extend their survival, quite ironic.  
  
## Healing Magic  
Healing magic is the creation of new tissue. Used to close flesh wounds, bone fractures, and other damages of non-complicated organs. Caution is advised when using healing magic as you can accidentally give yourself cancer if you’ve no knowledge on your own physiology.  
  
## Restoration Magic  
Restoration magic is the creation of new organs and limbs. Complete knowledge on anatomy and physiology is needed in order to safely use restoration magic. New limbs can be created in an extrusive manner or be created inside a pressure bladder, a sealed membrane filled with fluids (see [Enchantments](./Enchantments.md)).
