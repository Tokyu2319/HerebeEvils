Illusion magic is the use of [manon](./Mana.md) that targets the [mind](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Beings.md) by altering how it receives, filters, or interprets input from the [vessel](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Beings.md). Illusion magic affects all beings with a mind, regardless of whether their cognition is biological, artificial, or mana-based. An incredible amount of control is needed to effectively use illusion magic.

# Mnemonic Manipulation  
**Manon can alter the [memories](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Memory.md) inside a mind and make it tangible**. This allows a way to absorb not only information but [experience](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Experience.md) from another mind. The memories that you absorb from another may not gain you any experience if you’ve already experienced those moments yourself.  
Mnemonic manipulation allows the alteration of a mind’s memory, however, the memories from a vessel—if untouched—will override those alterations in the mind. It’s like a record that saves its writing for every new changes and the mind’s memories its revisions. So, to effectively alter the mind’s memory you also need to alter that record.  
  
<!--This was genuinely the hardest system to come up with. You can’t alter the brain using mechanical movement via manon but what you can do is manipulate the mind using manon. It’s a bit hand-wavy but it works-->
