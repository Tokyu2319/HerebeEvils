> A technique of [armana](./Mana.md) where it‘s design so it replicates the [complexities](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Beings.md) of the [mind](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Beings.md). If the armana structure replicates the complexities of the mind then it allows the use of armana as the secondary use of magic. It is the same as formulating the thought of converting [mana](./Mana.md) and moving it.  
# Examples of Enchantments  
- ## Staves, Tomes, Books, and More  
	These are enchantments in which the armana structure is designed so that spell casting is easier or requires less focus. This makes it easier for mages who are casting multiple spells requiring detailed attention.  
- ## Magical Shields and Smart Shields  
	Magical shields are enchantments in which the armana structure is designed so it releases more armana for the purpose of blocking or disrupting physical or magical attacks. The object may be the shield itself reinforced with armana being a protective layer, or the object as a trinket that releases a layer of armana.  
	  
	Smart shield are enchantments where it responds to the mind’s input. Some impenetrable shields are best turned off as they offer an airtight defense(which is bad if you need to breath), these shields are attributed to be smart so that they activate based on the user’s reflexes.  
- ## Magic Disruptors  
	Magic disruptors are enchantments in which the armana structure is designed so it releases manon and/or phani to disrupt spell casting. Making it so that conventional means to harm are effective against crippled mages.  
- ## Mana Batteries  
	Mana batteries are enchantments in which the armana structure is designed so it prolongs or pauses the decay of mana making it so that mana can be used at the ready or to power other enchantments.
