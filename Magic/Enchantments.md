A technique of [armana](./Mana.md) that is designed in such a way that it replicates the [complexities](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Beings.md) of the [mind](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Beings.md). If the armana structure replicates the such complexities then it allows the use of armana as the secondary use of magic. An example would be the action to convert [mana](./Mana.md) into its other types that’s been formatted onto the enchantment.  
# Examples of Enchantments  
- ## Staves, Tomes, Books, and More  
	These are enchantments where the armana structure is designed so that spell casting is easier or requires less focus. This makes it easier for mages who are casting multiple spells requiring detailed attention.  
- ## Magical Shields and Smart Shields  
	Magical shields are enchantments where the armana structure is designed so it releases more armana for the purpose of blocking or disrupting physical or magical attacks. The object may be the shield itself reinforced with armana serving as a protective layer, or the object as a trinket that releases a layer of armana.  
	  
	Magical shields offer an impenetrable air-tight defense but that’s actually bad if you need to see or breathe. Smart shields are designed in a way that they can distinguish what’s harmful or not, this includes, heat, toxic gas, physical attacks, and more.  
<!--I’ve almost forgotten what smart shields actually are-->  
- ## Magic Disruptors  
	Magic disruptors are enchantments where the armana structure is designed so it releases [manon](./Mana.md) and/or [phana](./Mana.md) to disrupt spell casting. Making it so that conventional means to harm are effective against crippled mages.  
- ## Mana Batteries  
	Mana batteries are enchantments where the armana structure is designed to prolong or pause the decay of mana making it so that mana can be used at the ready or to power other enchantments.  
- ## Vacuum-Displacement Chambers & Pressure Bladders  
	On the topic of creation magic, vacuum-displacement chambers (VDCs) and pressure bladders (PBs) are containers that are enchanted to allow easy use of creation magic.  
  
	VDCs are industrial/large scale vacuum chambers filled with perfluoropolyethers (PFPEs) as the medium for creation. Creating matter needs a vessel for the matter to be created from so [mana share](./Mana.md) is used on the VDC and the PFPE as extensions of a vessel in order to allow creation magic. PFPEs are fluorinated oils where every hydrogen is replaced with fluorine and they’re used in spacecraft mechanisms. PFPEs have the following properties of near-zero vapor pressure, chemically inert, vacuum clean, and stays liquid even at high and low temperatures. PFPEs are perfect for creation as they can be pushed when matter is created in the vacuum chamber which will then occupy the empty space above.  
	VDCs are used for sourcing large amounts of precious materials or the creation of large machinery.  
  
	PBs are small-scale sealed elastic membranes filled completely with liquids. PBs can be used to create what VDCs already create but they are mostly used to create biological materials. PBs are disposable as PBs are made to be teared opened once creation is done. water balloons are considered technically pressure bladders.
