> Soul bind magic is a spell where the [soul](./The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Beings.md) and [mind](./The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Beings.md) is bound to an object using manon and mana. Souls are already bound to their vessels as mana is already always in the being. In the case of a soul that’s about to enter [afterlife](./The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Transience.md), this type of magic could save their life.   
  
# How Does This Work?  
Soul bind magic works by first creating an armana vessel for the soul and mind to be bound to, if the armana structure replicates that of the being’s cognition they would be able to be aware of their predicament and further protect their mind from the lack of an appropriate vessel. Then manon is used to move both the soul and mind to the vessel and by using armana as a body, the soul and mind are safely contained in the armana vessel. Armana vessels could be substituted for other objects or vessels, the latter being easier to work around with.  
  
Use cases of soul bind magic is self-preservation during life threatening situations, prisons, [teleportation magic](./Teleportation%20Magic.md), or changing one’s vessel for a better one.
