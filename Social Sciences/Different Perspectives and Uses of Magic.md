This topic will explain the perspectives of magic that are used in my narratives. These paradigms describe differing interpretations, authorities, and applications of magic rather than mutually exclusive systems.  
  
# Instinctual Magic  
Often discovered by accident and mostly seen on simple [beings](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Beings.md) such as plants and animals. These beings are capable of magic but do not understand it and mostly use it based on their instincts.  
# Mythic Magic  
Magic seen an unexplainable phenomena often used in a modern setting where magic is nothing but fantasy.  
  
# Divine Magic  
A perspective defined by a higher being, sapient beings will follow these designed magics using systems laid out by the higher being. An example would be those isekai animes where they have a game system for their magical system, these game systems could be interpreted as a game designed by a developer. Limiting the use of magic.  
  
# Miracle Magic  
Not so much a perspective but a use of magic where beings draw mana from a higher being or a reservoir.  
  
# Thaumaturgy  
Magic understood as a systematized, reproducible, and researchable force — treated not as mysticism, but as a formal science.  
  
# Textbook  
Magic fully understood by understanding fundamentals such as [beings](../The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/Beings.md) and [Mana](../Magic/Mana.md).
