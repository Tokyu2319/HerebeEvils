Soul bind magic is a spell where a [soul](../2.%20The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/2.1%20Beings.md), whether they still have their [mind](../2.%20The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/2.1%20Beings.md) or not, is bound to an object or a vessel using [manon](./3.1%20Mana.md) and in the case where those two mediums are unavailable [armana](./3.1%20Mana.md) is used.  
  
If you were to put someone into a simple object, their mind will persist but won’t process because of the lack of senses. If, however, they were put inside an empty vessel with an equal level of cognitive function, then they’ll have complete awareness inside that vessel.  
  
If the vessel **is empty** and has a lower cognitive function than the subject, the subject will undergo regression and you may interpret that as you like. For the subject’s [memories](../2.%20The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/2.3%20Memory.md), the mind’s memories will try to fill up the empty vessel but much like hardware it undergoes compression, the identity of the subject (the mind’s memory) is completely present. If the mind **is empty** and has a higher cognitive function than the subject, the subject will simply have more to do. It’s like upgrading from a computer to a supercomputer.  
  
If the vessel is occupied or is unable to sustain a mind, the subject will have their mind slowly expire.  
  
Use cases of soul bind magic is self-preservation during life threatening situations, prisons, [teleportation magic](../3.8%20Teleportation%20Magic.md), or changing one’s vessel for a better one.
