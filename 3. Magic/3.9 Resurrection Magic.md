The use of a donor [soul](../2.%20The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/2.1%20Beings.md) to resurrect another soul to restore its [identity](../2.%20The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/2.3%20Memory.md). When resurrection happens the donor soul is sacrificed and **destroyed** in order to restore the [mind](../2.%20The%20Principles%20of%20Beings/2.1%20Beings.md) of the recipient soul. Recipient souls needs an equal amount of donated soul value for their resurrection, the sacrifice can be multiple donor souls or one equal donor soul.  
  
If the recipient soul receives less than their required soul value their resurrection will become degraded, this can be fixed by providing the necessary amount of donor souls.  
  
Resurrection can happen naturally but the odds are low and will only become prevalent during the end of the universe.
