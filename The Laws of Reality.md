# Finite in Infinity
The universe is infinite but possibilities are finite. When the universe is infinite and possibilities are limited, the universe is bound to repeat those possibilities. Meaning if you venture out into the edges of the universe, you’re likely to find a person whose being is an almost exact version of you. These are regions of the universe where they repeat themselves but with different causalities.
# This is a Coarse-Grained Universe
A coarse-grained universe is what I define a universe who only allows the macro scale of significances. As stated before, the universe is made up of different regions, however, when you travel to a neighboring region you wouldn’t see not even a micro difference. A single particle decays a nanosecond earlier in this region? No, this region would meaningfully be different. A version of you might’ve made a choice where they became someone different than what you would’ve chose, and the same goes for everyone in the neighboring region.

Yes the universe is different and we cannot deny that they’re regions where micro differences exist yet how come the region next to yours is vastly different? The universe would treat these micro-scale differences to be of the same region. That means every possibility containing a micro-scale significance is compiled into one region. A merging of sorts.

How different can these regions be? That depends on the author.
- ## The Shape of Each Region and The Shape of The Universe
	A region in the universe takes on the geometric shape called a truncated octahedron, see image below:
	![[./image.gif|200]] 
	It is an octahedron with its corners cut off
	It has 8 hexagons and 6 Squares as its faces
	It has 36 edges and 24 vertices and it’s Archimedean, meaning highly symmetric
	These characteristics allow the truncated octahedron to be tiled with each other leaving no empty spaces. The gif below is what 15 of these regions would look like:

	All of this is to show that there’s a threshold between regions separating them, signifying that you have left your region and are about to enter another.
