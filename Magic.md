> This topic will explain how the [mana triad](./Mana.md) and created matter interact with each other.  
# Interactions Between The Mana Triad  
- ## Raw Mana Interaction  
	- Mana + Phana = More Phana, more luminosity or/and more heat.  
	- Mana + Manon = intense force.  
	- Mana + Armana = Mana decays slower while armana becomes more tangible/solidified.  
- ## Phana Interaction  
	- Phana + Mana = More Phana, more luminosity or/and more heat.  
	- Phana + Manon = More focus and control on beam and wavelengths.  
	- Phana + Armana = Inert but intense heat can disrupt the armana structure.  
- ## Manon Interaction  
	- Manon + Mana = intense force.  
	- Manon + Phana = Allows focus and control over beam and wavelengths.  
	- Manon + Armana = Allows changes in Armana structure and complexity.  
- ## Armana Interaction  
	- Armana + Mana = Mana decays slower while armana becomes more tangible/solidified.  
	- Armana + Phana = Inert but intense heat can disrupt the armana structure.  
	- Armana + Manon = Allows changes in Armana structure and complexity.  
# Matter Interaction  
- ## Raw Mana Interaction  
	It is inert, it phases through materials.  
- ## Phana interaction  
	Inert but intense heat may cause matter to change phases such as melting.  
- ## Manon Interaction  
	Allows control over anything really. Want to heat the bathtub? Use manons to vibrate the water molecules. Want to freeze water? Use manons to gradually lock water molecules in place (I say gradually because if not you’re gonna end up with plasma). Want to see a solar eclipse? Stretch large amounts of manons to the moon in order to move it however you like.  
- ## Armana Interaction  
	Since armana is tangible it can collide with matter. This is useful for shields if an opposing mage decides to use a gun instead of magic.

# Spell Examples  
- ## Flamethrower  
	A mage creates flammable gasses from their palms in which they control their movement using manons, they then ignite the gasses using a burst of hot phana. They continually create gasses to fuel the flame until their enemy is burned.  
- ## Lightning  
	The mage stretches manon over the field of influence, this can easily be disrupted by opposing mages.
